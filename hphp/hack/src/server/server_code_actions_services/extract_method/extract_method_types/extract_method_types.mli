      Examples of expression selections:

        $x = ( 100  + 200  ) + 300

              ^---^

              ^--------------------------^

        *As of this writing*, when the selection corresponds to an expression, we:
        - replace the original expression with a call expression,
        but don't assign to a variable.
        - calculate the return type of the extracted method based on the type of
        the expression we are replacing.

      Examples of statement selections:

        if (cond()) {  $x0 = true;   $x1 = true;  $z = 5; }
                       ^---------^

        *As of this writing, when the selection corresponds to a statement, we:
        - Add a method call. If the method is not an iterator then we assign to a variable.
          Example: `$x = $this->placeholder()`. If the method is an iterator, we do something
          more interesting, see test cases.
        - Calculate the return type based on what variables are reassigned in the selection region
        and used after the selection region. For example, if the selection includes `$x =p 3; $y = 5;`
        and both `$x` and `$y` are used later, then the return type is `(int, int)` and the call site
        is something like `list($x, $y) = $this->placeholder();`
