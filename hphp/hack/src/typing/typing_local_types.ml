(* Along with a type, each local variable has a expression id associated with
   * it. This is used when generating expression dependent types for the 'this'
   * type. The idea is that if two local variables have the same expression_id
   * then they refer to the same late bound type, and thus have compatible
   * 'this' types.

   * error, but any assigning to it should still follow the bound. *)
