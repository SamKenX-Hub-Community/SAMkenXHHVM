(** Represents the "fanout" of a change, representing the cached
    information we must invalidate and the files we must re-typecheck if we want
    to produce a correct list of all errors in the repository which reflects
    those changes. *)
type t = {
  changed: Typing_deps.DepSet.t;
      (** The subset of classes in changed files whose decls changed (excluding
          classes whose decls experienced a positions-only change). *)
  to_recheck: Typing_deps.DepSet.t;
      (** This set represents the dependents of the declarations which were
          changed. In order to detect all errors which may have resulted from
          the changes, we must re-typecheck all files containing these
          dependents. Because DepSet.t is lossy--it is only a set of symbol
          hashes--we cannot precisely reproduce the set of symbols which need
          rechecking. Instead, Typing_deps maintains a mapping from symbol hash
          to filename (exposed via Typing_deps.get_files). *)
